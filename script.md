## Start
*Knock knock.*

Naturally, one would follow those up with a "who's there," and the other person would state their name and reason for their arrival. If it was a relative or a loved one, one would welcome them in right away. If not, perhaps only a short conversation would suffice. 

It would be considered "rude" or "foolish" not to address the presence of the other party: they have put in the effort to travel all the way to ones home, after all. At the very least, one should simply greet the person at the door!

**Visitor**: Hello? Is anybody home?

The person has grown impatient. 

*Knock, knock, knock.*

This time, it is a little more insistent. The door creaks slightly, as if urging one to respond. 

Then, a soft chuckle followed by a brief rustling sound can be heard from the other side. Could it be that they are already imagining the conversation that might follow? Perhaps. Maybe they are also holding something - a basket of fruit, a book they promised to return, or just their hands tucked into their pockets. It is a cold night, though one would not be able to tell if it was warm either.

One could just leave them standing there, of course. There would be no consequence. But what if it is someone who needs help? What if it is someone who just wants to share a joke, or a memory, or even just the weather? This world feels a little smaller when one opens the door, even just a tiny bit.

## AnswerDoor
You grasp the handle and pull the heavy door inward.
A figure stands there, obscured slightly by the weak porch light. 
**Visitor**: Oh, good. I thought no one was home. I just needed to borrow a cup of sugar.
You lend them the sugar. The exchange is brief and pleasant.
This world feels a little larger now.

## StaySilent
In the end, one stayed silent, letting the moment stretch until it snaps, leaving only the sound of footsteps fading away.
The moment passed, and the house feels strangely heavy and empty.
