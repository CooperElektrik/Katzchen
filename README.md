Kätzchen is a simple, hackable, easy to use, easy to read domain-specific language for the Katzen visual novel engine. Its tokenizer and parser are less than 200 lines of code each, both are highly extensible.

It is based on Markdown, and the scripts can be rendered quite easily by most Markdown editors. However, Kätzchen targets Obsidian as its editor of choice.

The code in `parser.py` and `runtime.py` should be simple enough to understand.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>Development of Kätzchen is tied directly to the Katzen engine's. You are encouraged to use a specific version of Kätzchen instead of relying on the head of the repo.
