## Take the girl

>Is that so? It'll help both me and this girl out.

>This girl is a slave without any relatives.
>You can have her help around the house, or if you have such preferences you can treat her like your toy.
>There is no one who would object.
>
>If you want to know more about her, you can ask her.
>Then I shall take my leave.

>Once again, thank you very much for saving me that day.

The man left.
